1.  When you ‘Add new project’ the database takes you to overview section as opposed to ‘edit’ mode of PGI from where you will actually create the project.
-Done

2. ‘Create new project’ should be the same as(look and feel) ‘create new finance object/M&E’. In order to maintain the consistency of the ‘create’ function. Additionally all create should be under the drop down ‘Add’. Further, change ‘M&E object’ to say ‘evaluation type’.
-Done

3. In the previous version and this version we could not spot where to add sub project.
-Done

4. ‘Projects A – Z’ should always appear on the top most navigation bar, next to HOME, FILTERED SEARCH, ABOUT. This will avoid too many clicks one might have to do to work on a different project.
-Done

5. Save/Cancel options at the bottom of the edit mode, should also be available at the top to avoid one scrolling down a long page, just to save one small change.
-Not easy UI change.

6. When in a project, the blue header should list the full project title and not the section of the database e.g. Biodiversity Project instead of Project General Information. 
-Done

7. Is it possible to change the database id from alpha numeric to numeric only? E.g. change from Prj – 00001 to 00001?
-Done

8. If joint implementation option is No, Lead Agency and contact should not appear in view mode.
-Done

9. In PGI, project result, leverage financing and description should be at the bottom.
-Done

10. Starting from GEF allocation to Total Yearly expenditures, appearing in PGI (after strategic program) were supposed to be in finance object view. (please refer to the data dictionary and see screen shot below). On the same screen the PDF A/ PDF B/ etc status, Should not be in PGI view but in Finance overview section.(Please refer to the data dictionary).
-Done

11. As requested in previous comments and our discussions in stellenbosch, we need validations for EA BD/CC/POPs and Operational Programs/Strategic Programs/Strategic Objectives/Strategic Priorities. Details provided in the data dictionary.
-Done

12. Under M&E when we create MTR it says MTR – 1. Please change this to read Mid Term Review (with no number).
-Done

13. Under M&E, provision for PIR ratings should always be available. Note that PIR is independent of the Evaluation/Review.
-Done

14. As rightly pointed out by Mike during the telecom, ‘add new row’ for Terminal Evaluation Report Rating is not required since the entry is done only once.
-Done
