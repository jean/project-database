Database roles:
. Administrator
. Registrar (milestones including those in PFD)
. Task Manager (PGI rights, MTR rights in M&E)
. Fund Management Officer (FMI rights)
. Senior Programme Officer (SPO) (the only difference with the TM role is that
  he/she publishes “private concepts” and has Programme Framework editing
  rights)
. SPMO (the only role is that he/she rates country risk)
. Monitoring Officer (M&E rights but only specific fields)
. Evaluation Officer (M&E rights but only specific fields)
. Senior Manager (editing rights on all sections but will not administer). Only
  one staff in the Division should have such rights.


Notes:
. Programme Assistants will have the same role as Task Managers. However, they
  will log in with their own names and passwords for auditing purposes
. Finance Assistants will have the same role as FMOs. However, they will log in
  with their own names and passwords for auditing purposes
. It has been agreed that for the time being the SPMO’s only special role is to
  rate country risk. He will be able to view all data but will not have editing
  rights.
. The registrar requires a backstop. The same person may be trained to also
  provide backstopping to the Administrator.
