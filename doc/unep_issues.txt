-Done

3. We had wanted a thousand separator to appear just when one finishes entering data in any figure field i.e after hitting the ‘tab’ or clicking on the next field
-Create MoneyColumn for DGF

4. In view mode, spacing in field labels is missing for some e.g Total cofinance planned / actual & Total Cost etc.
