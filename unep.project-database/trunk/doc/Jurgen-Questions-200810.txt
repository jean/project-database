From the Data Dictionary
========================

ProjectGeneralInformation
-------------------------
- What does a filtered field, i.e. used in online searches mean? 


Financial Management Information
--------------------------------
- Should the 'Reports' field be removed from Financial Management Information? 
- Is the 'Reports' field in FMI replaced by the 'Mid Term Review' and 'Terminal Evaluation' fields in the M&E section, or should it be a field in its own right in the M&E section? If so, what are the relationship, if any, between 'Reports' and the 'MTR' and 'TE' report fields in M&E?
- Must 'Project Revision' still be in FMI. I do not see it in the data dictionary, and it is not mentioned in the DB-Comments document. If yes, where does it fit in the schema?
- Where must the new fields fit into the FMI schema? RevisedAllocationToUNEP, CommittedGEFGrant, Difference
- Where do the following fields fit into the schema? PDFResults, TerminalEvaluationBudget, MidTermEvaluationBudget
- Would it be possible to shorten the text of the options in the lists?

Sub-Project/MOU
---------------
Should the new Trustee ID field be in sub-project/MOU?


Milestones
----------
Having difficulty matching data dictionary to current class in UML model.


Monitoring and Evaluation
-------------------------
You mention that we should display fields from other sections, instead of having them as editable fields in M&E. The list I have been given is as follows. I have added a column to indicate where I could locate the fields. Some are only listed in the M&E section, so they should be editable here. Please see if you agree with my assessment.
