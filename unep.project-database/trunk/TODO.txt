THINGS TO DO ON UNEP PROJECT
* Print and Send Email links
* Skin Organisation

* Import historical data

OUTSTANDING REPORTS
* Programme Framework
    Requires change to reporting mechanism
* Projects at risk

ISSUES
* Text boxes – all over the database – should be small but expandible (not to discourage TMs)
    -Add rows to textareas and max-height to kupu
* Save/Cancel options at the bottom of the edit mode, should also be available at the top to avoid one scrolling down a long page, just to save one small change.
    -Not easy UI change.

BUG FIXES
Await Feedback * PDF Reports failing

MISCELLANEOOUS
* Thousand separators
