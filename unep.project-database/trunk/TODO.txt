* In view mode, spacing in field labels is missing for some e.g Total cofinance planned / actual & Total Cost etc.
    -Asked for all issues
* Save/Cancel options at the bottom of the edit mode, should also be available at the top to avoid one scrolling down a long page, just to save one small change.
