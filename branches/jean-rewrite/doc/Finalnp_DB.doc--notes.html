<li  class="L1" >Automatic logout <ol>
<p  class="P2" >make sure that it is necessary to log-in even after you have closed PLONE
without Logging Out.
</p>
<li  class="L2" >Use SessionCrumbler http://plone.org/products/sessioncrumbler <ol>
<p  class="P3" >The web is stateless. The server doesn't know when you close a
browser window. The best we can do is letting sessions time out after
a certain period. There is a product called SessionCrumbler which
facilitates this. It should be possible to swap out Plone's existing
CookieCrumbler with SessionCrumbler. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li  class="L1" >Undo <ol>
<p  class="P2" >After adding a new project, I could not UNDO the changes I made and
neither can Eric
</p>
<li  class="L2" >Use versioning <ol>
<p  class="P3" >Don't depend on "Undo" functionality in an application context. It's
database-level functionality that is frequently unusable and
sometimes dangerous (undoing a change in one object might render the
application state as a whole inconsistent). If it is necessary to be
able to revert to older versions of objects, use versioning instead.
For the current state of the art, see
http://plone.org/events/conferences/seattle-2006/presentations/versioning-at-last.pdf/view </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li  class="L1" >Google search <ol>
<p  class="P2" >We need to be able to search within a page with GOOGLE. Possible?
</p>
<li  class="L2" >Clarification needed <ol>
<p  class="P3" >It's certainly possible to use Google to search the site. It doesn't
really make sense to use it to search one single page, so this can't
be what is meant. What's lacking with Plone's search? Perhaps it's
something that can be fixed with some configuration. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li  class="L1" >CSS & UI work <ol>
<li  class="L2" >Changes to field labels, field order or templates <ol>
<li  class="L3" >Rename "UNEP DGEF Projects" to "UNEP GEF Projects"
<li  class="L3" >Rename: Project core to read Project General Information
<li  class="L3" >Rename Financial Management Information to Project Financial Information.
<li  class="L3" >Rename Milestones to Project Cycle Milestones
<li  class="L3" >When a Project is selected show the title of the latest project
<li  class="L3" >Fonts for the Project title could be slightly smaller
<li  class="L3" >The top menu bar should remain fixed when you scroll
<li  class="L3" >The Project's Status: shown immediately after the project title.
<li  class="L3" >In addition: Add columns for Milestone and Dates
<li  class="L3" >.. and elsewhere </ol>
<li  class="L2" >Templating <ol>
<p  class="P3" >Templates that need structural reworking
</p>
<li  class="L3" >Need to have a function that allows you to view a list of ALL projects
<li  class="L3" >The search results page
<li  class="L3" >In the OVERVIEW section, we need links to these documents ... </ol>
<li  class="L2" >Widgets <ol>
<li  class="L3" >Change behaviour of country selection widget; see II.5
<li  class="L3" >Is this a Tranched project? Check boxes for either YES OR NO. If yes .. <ol>
<p  class="P4" >Alternative implementation: display "Not tranched", and then: "if
this is a tranched project, enter the number of tranches". If it
is a tranched project, show a field with the number of tranches
with "if this is not a tranched project, enter 0 in this field" </p>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<li  class="L1" >Links <ol>
<p  class="P2" >Is it possible to add links within the sections
</p>
<li  class="L2" >Clarification needed <ol>
<p  class="P3" >What are links in this context? Plone Link objects, or "related" site
content? </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li  class="L1" >Rights & security <ol>
<p  class="P2" >Audit based on directions in various places in Finalnp_DB
</p>
<li  class="L2" >Task Manager <ol>
<p  class="P3" >This needs to be a role or a group. Consider one of the "group"
products, e.g. GrufSpaces, TeamSpace (depends on CMFMember),
PloneWorkspaces, mxmWorkgroups, ... </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li  class="L1" >Fields & functionality <ol>
<li  class="L2" >The ADD option should allow the user to enter any other type of EA <ol>
<p  class="P3" >Should these then be available in the list for future EA selections? </p>
</ol>
<li  class="L2" >Add various lookup content types <ol>
<p  class="P3" >These supply the vocabularies for various dropdowns. Take care of
referential integrity (if one of these is in use, don't allow
deletion.) Here are some of the types I have in mind:
</p>
<li  class="L3" >UNEP regions
<li  class="L3" >GEF eligible countries
<li  class="L3" >GEF 3 Strategic Priorities
<li  class="L3" >GEF 4 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES </ol>
<li  class="L2" >Agencies <ol>
<li  class="L3" >Use e.g. mxmContacts or UpfrontContacts for this? <ol>
<p  class="P4" >I think mxmContacts may already be in use. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li  class="L2" >Fee <ol>
<li  class="L3" >Use Upfront's Money type for all financial fields. <ol>
<p  class="P4" >It handles money arithmetic, currencies, display, widgets .. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
<li  class="L2" >This option should only be available when you choose INTERNAL. <ol>
<p  class="P3" >Either use schemata, where this field is on the 2nd schemata, or use
Azax to render this field conditionally, or show both with a warning
at the 2nd one. </ol>
