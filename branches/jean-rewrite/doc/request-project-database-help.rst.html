<div class="document" id="request-for-help-on-unep-project-database-application">
<p>UNEP has developed a Project Database application, to keep track of and
manage proposed and running projects. This is a Plone product with
Archetypes-based content types. There are 7 content types now, with
22 schemas shared among them, numbering some 66 fields in total, and 3
workflows.</p>
<p>The project does not always follow best practices, and some refactoring
may turn out to be advisable.</p>
<p>They have now completed an internal review which has resulted in a
number of change requests. Types of changes include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Addition of functionality. This may involve integration of third-party
products.</li>
<li>Adding and editing of page templates for editing and reporting.</li>
<li>Changes to field labels and field order within templates.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="products-to-be-integrated">
<h1><a name="products-to-be-integrated">Products to be integrated</a></h1>

are candidates for integration:</p>

<p>Currently a number of vocabularies that need to be managed are defined.
It may make sense to change these into simple content types that provide
the vocabulary.</p>
